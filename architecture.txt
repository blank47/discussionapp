Microservices Architecture Breakdown

For a discussion platform with user interactions, you can structure your system into the following microservices:
User Service
•	Responsibilities: Manages user registration, authentication, profile updates, and user data retrieval.
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /users - Create a new user
o	GET /users/{id} - Retrieve user information
o	PUT /users/{id} - Update user information
o	DELETE /users/{id} - Delete a user
Discussion Service
•	Responsibilities: Handles all operations related to discussions such as creating, updating, fetching, and deleting discussions.
•	Endpoints:
o	POST /discussions - Create a new discussion
o	GET /discussions/{id} - Retrieve a specific discussion
o	PUT /discussions/{id} - Update a discussion
o	DELETE /discussions/{id} - Delete a discussion
o	GET /discussions - List discussions with filters
Currently we did include Likes Follows and Comments as well, we can separate each database into different services as well
